Doree had to take three buses—one to Kincardine, where she waited for one to London, where she 
waited again, for the city bus out to the facility. She started the trip on a Sunday at nine in 
the morning. Because of the waiting times between buses, it took her until about two in the 
afternoon to travel the hundred-odd miles. All that sitting, either on buses or in the depots, was 
not a thing she should have minded. Her daily work was not of the sitting-down kind.

She was a chambermaid at the Comfort Inn. She scrubbed bathrooms and stripped and made beds and 
vacuumed rugs and wiped mirrors. She liked the work—it occupied her thoughts to a certain extent 
and tired her out so that she could sleep at night. She was seldom faced with a really bad mess, 
though some of the women she worked with could tell stories to make your hair curl. These women 
were older than her, and they all thought that she should try to work her way up. They told her 
that she should get trained for a job behind the desk, while she was still young and decent-
looking. But she was content to do what she did. She didn’t want to have to talk to people.
